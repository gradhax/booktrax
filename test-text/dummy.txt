That movie was fantastic! I had a wonderful time. I just absolutely loved every second of it. I've never been happier in life. Totally my favorite.
On the other hand, that book was terrible. Wow, what a complete waste of time. I've never been more insulted. No one should be allowed within 10 feet of that novel.
Like the previous book, the kombucha flavor was not pleasing to me. Oh man, just too weird. Who would think to combine those flavors? Some dummy, that's who.
Let's continue with the negativity train. You know what's the worst? Happy hours that end too early. No one wants to pay full price for that stale pint!
Back to good news: we're expecting! A beautiful baby boy will grace us next fall. This has to be the second best thing that's happened to me after that movie described in the first few sentences.
